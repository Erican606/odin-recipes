    <p>Chicken and pasta. How can you hate it.</p>
    <p><strong><em>If you hate it no you don't.</em></strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken <Strong><em>(Breast only)</em></Strong></li>
        <li>Pasta <strong><em>(Fettuchin)</em></strong></li>
        <li>Alfredo Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the noodles:</li> 
            <p>Cook the Fettuchin until it sticks to anything you throw it at.</p>
        <li>Cook the chicken:</li>
           <p>Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</p>
        <li>Make the Alfredo sauce:</li>
            <p> Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</p>
        <li>Assemble:</li>
            <p>Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</p>
    </ol>
